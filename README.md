# My AI Agency - GlowSync Project

Welcome to the **My AI Agency** workspace. This repository contains the orchestration for a virtual AI agency that automates the product development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to QA planning, specifically applied to the **GlowSync** project.

## 🚀 Overview

GlowSync is a unified web-based solution for professional makeup artists (MUAs). It simplifies portfolio management and booking by providing a high-aesthetic public-facing site integrated with a robust availability engine and administrative dashboard.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `glowsync/`: The main Next.js application codebase.
  - `src/`: Application logic, including API routes and UI components.
  - `prisma/`: Database schema and configuration.
- `agents.py`: Defines the specialized AI agents (Product Manager, Architect, Security Engineer, QA Engineer).
- `tasks.py`: Defines the tasks assigned to each agent.
- `main.py`: The entry point for the AI orchestration pipeline.
- `PRD.md`: Product Requirement Document generated by the PM agent.
- `TechSpec.md`: Technical Specification generated by the Architect agent.
- `SecurityReview.md`: Security analysis generated by the Security Engineer agent.
- `QAPlan.md`: Quality Assurance plan generated by the QA Engineer agent.

## ⚙️ AI Orchestration Pipeline

The agency uses [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomoura/crewAI) to manage a team of specialized agents. You can start the pipeline from different phases using the CLI control panel:

1. **PM Phase**: Starts from scratch with a new app idea.
2. **Architect Phase**: Generates technical specifications based on an existing PRD.
3. **Security Phase**: Conducts a security review of the PRD and Tech Spec.
4. **QA Phase**: Creates a testing plan based on all previous documents.

To run the pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```
